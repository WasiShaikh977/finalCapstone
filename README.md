# Final Capstone Project
###  Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis project

This model used the power of NLP to determine the sentiment of a customer's review. It categorizes the review as being either positive, negative or neutral. Given the amount of products being sold and reviews being submitted on websites like Amazon, it becomes practically impossible for a human to manually analyse what the people are thinking about a particular product. Our model does this in seconds.
